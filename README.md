# Code-Cracker
An adaptation of "Code Breaker" Persona 1 minigame using Tkinter

Guess the code in 8 turns:
  — orange labels show how many numbers in row or colon are in their place;
  — green labels show how many numbers are in their row or colon, but not in place;
  — left click to switch to increase number from 1 to 9, right click to decrease;
  — middle button to highlight numbers
