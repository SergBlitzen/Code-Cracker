# Code Cracker
An adaptation of "Code Breaker" Persona 1 minigame using Tkinter

Guess the code in 8 turns by changing numbers and determining it's right place.

## Rules and controls
<br>— Each code contains distinct unique numbers from 1 to 9;
<br>— Orange labels shows how many numbers in row or column are in their place;
<br>— Green labels shows how many numbers are in their row or column, but not in place;
<br>— Left click to increase number, right click to decrease;
<br>— Middle button to highlight numbers;
<br>— Labels on top of main space highlights which numbers are currently used.

## Launch options
For now the only option to launch is to run "main.py" file.

## Version features
New version has updated structure and more logical OOP-approach, although there is still some DRY violations.
Updated code has more automation which could be optimized for more in-game on the run customization.

## Future updates
There may be some future updates with added features such as difficulty level select or multiple turn options, but no ETA for now
